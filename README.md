A simple single-binary webserver written in go (yay!).

Please note that this is a learning project.

## Getting Started

You'll need a text editor and `go > 1.16` installed

```
go version
```

### Installing

To get running, just create / update the content in `content/` and then build.

```
go build -ldflags '-s'
```

And there you go - a full static in a single binary!
